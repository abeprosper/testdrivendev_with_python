# tdd_basic_TestDrivenDevelopment

Two additional branches were created, namely
coding_without_tdd;
coding_with_tdd

Initial attempt to write the applications was done without reference to Test Driven Development using the branch, "coding_without_tdd", changes were later merged with the master branch and a release version was created.
